# uBeac Sensor Data Monitoring is an application that helps to collect sensors data from smart devices and send them to the uBeac's cloud service. You will be able to monitor and visualize sensors real-time data using your own created dashboards and save them on the cloud for future use. The application sends data in JSON format via HTTP/HTTPS to uBeac's IoT hub.
# To visualize the data, you should register/login to your account in uBeac. Then create a team and assign a new gateway to the team. In gateway's detail page, you can define the gateway's URL and type it in the application's setting page.
